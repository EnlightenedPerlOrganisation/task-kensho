CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to this distribution.  This file
contains instructions that will help you work with the source code.

PLEASE NOTE that if you have any questions or difficulties, you can reach the
maintainer(s) through the bug queue described later in this document
(preferred), or by emailing the releaser directly. You are not required to
follow any of the steps in this document to submit a patch or bug report;
these are just recommendations, intended to help you (and help us help you
faster).

The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla (https://metacpan.org/release/Dist-Zilla).
This means than many of the usual files you might expect are not in the
repository, but are generated at release time (e.g. Makefile.PL).

However, you can run tests directly using the 'prove' tool:

  $ prove -l
  $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t
  $ prove -lvr t/

In most cases, 'prove' is entirely sufficent for you to test any
patches you have.

You may need to satisfy some dependencies.  The easiest way to satisfy
dependencies is to install the last release -- this is available at
https://metacpan.org/release/Task-Kensho

If you use cpanminus, you can do it without downloading the tarball first:

  $ cpanm --reinstall --installdeps --with-recommends Task::Kensho

Dist::Zilla is a very powerful authoring tool, but requires a number of
author-specific plugins.  If you would like to use it for contributing,
install it from CPAN, then run one of the following commands, depending on
your CPAN client:

  $ cpan `dzil authordeps --missing`
or
  $ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm

You should then also install any additional requirements not needed by the
dzil build but may be needed by tests or other development:

  $ cpan `dzil listdeps --author --missing`
or
  $ dzil listdeps --author --missing | cpanm

Or, you can use the 'dzil stale' command to install all requirements at once:

  $ cpan Dist::Zilla::App::Command::stale
  $ cpan `dzil stale --all`
or
  $ cpanm Dist::Zilla::App::Command::stale
  $ dzil stale --all | cpanm

You can also do this via cpanm directly:

  $ cpanm --reinstall --installdeps --with-develop --with-recommends Task::Kensho

Once installed, here are some dzil commands you might try:

  $ dzil build
  $ dzil test
  $ dzil test --release
  $ dzil xtest
  $ dzil listdeps --json
  $ dzil build --notgz

The code for this distribution is hosted at GitHub. The repository is:
https://github.com/EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho
You can submit code changes by forking the repository, pushing your code
changes to your clone, and then submitting a pull request. Detailed
instructions for doing that is available here:

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request

If you have found a bug, but do not have an accompanying patch to fix it, you
can submit an issue report here:
https://github.com/EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho/issues


There is also an irc channel available for users of this distribution, at
irc://irc.perl.org/#epo

If you send me a patch or pull request, your name and email address will be
included in the documentation as a contributor (using the attribution on the
commit or patch), unless you specifically request for it not to be.  If you
wish to be listed under a different name or address, you should submit a pull
request to the .mailmap file to contain the correct mapping.
