This is the Perl distribution {{ $dist->name }}.

Installing {{ $dist->name }} is straightforward.  You do however need to use
a CPAN client that knows how to interpret the "optional_feature" field in
META.yml or META.json.  At this time, App::cpanminus is known to work:

  cpanm --interactive {{ $dist->name =~ s/-/::/gr }}
