# XXX FIXME: http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/dist/Task-Kensho

-----------

** problems:
    - metaprovides is empty (distmeta running too soon - because of Test::PodSpelling
        for now, we need to dump both plugins and send patches.
    - kwalitee is failing, claiming no modules found eihter (this is because it depends on 'provides', when present.)  solved by removing spelling and provides plugins
    - Git::Check.allow_dirty is not being set      ..problem in Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles
        workaround used, issue sent to rjbs.
    - Git::Check is ignoring uncommitted files in .. when in subtask dir <--
        - 'repo_root' needs to be set?  <-- TODO: repo_root is poorly documented. not mentioned in [Git::Check]
        (maybe solve with hard links from this repo?)

- automatically detect when a dist changes, and mark that as needing release?
    (can be done with Makefiles and committing the release version of the tree
    -- ether will investigate after ripping out MI.)

- should Task::Kensho always get re-released when a subdist changes? or should
  TK just list the categories and not list the actual components?
    - TK should always get re-released when a sub-dist changes. 
      The sub-dist is a hack around CPAN clients not reliably 
      doing optional deps. -- Chris
        - cpan clients should be supporting optional deps now -- I know cpanm
          does support "optional_features" --
          https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Meta::Spec#optional_features
          -- so given that information, do we want to keep subdists at all?



-----------

need to go through and audit all modules' existence.

remove Module::Install; add Dist::Milla and Milla.

13:50 <@ether> does anyone have any opinions on Devel::Hide vs. Test::Without::Module?

remove mentioning Module::Build
