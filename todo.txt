10:33 < ranguard> having all 3 ::Tiny is a bit confusing, as they're split up in the list, but I'm guessing it's Alphabetical?
10:36 < ranguard> ether: btw, ignore any/all of these, just saying what I see, might be better to ship something rather than add new modules!

- should Task::Kensho always get re-released when a subdist changes? or should
  TK just list the categories and not list the actual components?
    - TK should always get re-released when a sub-dist changes.
      The sub-dist is a hack around CPAN clients not reliably
      doing optional deps. -- Chris
        - cpan clients should be supporting optional deps now -- I know cpanm
          does support "optional_features" --
          https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Meta::Spec#optional_features
          -- so given that information, do we want to keep subdists at all?



-----------

need to go through and audit all modules' existence.

add Dist::Milla or Minilla?

13:50 <@ether> does anyone have any opinions on Devel::Hide vs. Test::Without::Module?

JSON::MaybeXS
File::Slurper
