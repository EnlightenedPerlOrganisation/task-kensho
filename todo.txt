Investigate ways to generate these dists with a minimum amount of effort,
ideally dumping Module::Install.

- automatically detect when a dist changes, and mark that as needing release?
    (can be done with Makefiles and committing the release version of the tree
    -- ether will investigate after ripping out MI.)

- should Task::Kensho always get re-released when a subdist changes? or should
  TK just list the categories and not list the actual components?
    - TK should always get re-released when a sub-dist changes. 
      The sub-dist is a hack around CPAN clients not reliably 
      doing optional deps. -- Chris
        - cpan clients should be supporting optional deps now -- I know cpanm
          does support "optional_features" --
          https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Meta::Spec#optional_features
          -- so given that information, do we want to keep subdists at all?
