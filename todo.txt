Investigate ways to generate these dists with a minimum amount of effort.

- slurp in the master file of dists and components
- generate Makefile.PL etc.
    - keep using Module::Install?
    - investigate rjbs's Taskweaver dzil plugin

- automatically detect when a dist changes, and mark that as needing release?

- should Task::Kensho always get re-released when a subdist changes? or should
  TK just list the categories and not list the actual components?
    - TK should always get re-released when a sub-dist changes. 
      The sub-dist is a hack around CPAN clients not reliably 
      doing optional deps. -- Chris
