Task-Kensho version 0.0.1

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensho :

    Kenshō (見性) (C. Wu) is a Japanese term for enlightenment experiences—most
    commonly used within the confines of Zen Buddhism—literally meaning
    "seeing one's nature" or "true self." It generally "refers to the
    realization of nonduality of subject and object."
    
Task::Kensho is a first cut at building a list of reccomended modules for
Enlightened Perl development. CPAN is wonderful, but there are too many wheels
and you have to pick and choose amongst the various competing technologies. 

The plan is for Task::Kensho to eventually morph into an actual perl 
distribution possibly called Satori Perl.

The modules that are bundled by Task::Kensho are broken down into several 
categories and are still being considered. They are all taken from various 
top 100 most used perl modules lists.
