Task-Kensho
-----------

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensho:

    Kenshō (見性) (C. Wu) is a Japanese term for enlightenment experiences—most
    commonly used within the confines of Zen Buddhism—literally meaning
    "seeing one's nature"[1] or "true self."[2] It generally "refers to the
    realization of nonduality of subject and object."[3]

Task::Kensho is a first cut at building a list of recommended modules for
Enlightened Perl development. CPAN is wonderful, but there are too many wheels
and you have to pick and choose amongst the various competing technologies.

The plan is for Task::Kensho to be a rough testing ground for ideas that go
into among other things the Enlightened Perl Organisation Extended Core
(EPO-EC).

The modules that are bundled by Task::Kensho are broken down into several
categories and are still being considered. They are all taken from various top
100 most used perl modules lists and from discussions with various subject
matter experts in the Perl Community. That said this bundle does I<not> follow
the guidelines established for the EPO-EC for peer review via industry
advisers.

Starting in 2011, Task::Kensho split its sub-groups of modules into
individually-installable tasks. These individual tasks will always install all
their modules by default. This facilitates the ease and simplicity the
distribution aims to achieve. Each Task::Kensho sub-task is listed at the

Then in 2013, the distributions were reunified again, with each subset of
modules as discrete sets of optional features. At installation time, you will
be prompted to determine which sets you wish to install.
